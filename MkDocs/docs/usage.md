# Usage

The information to create a project will be entered into a google form at https://goo.gl/forms/xeNxgnVAnAmmIVJJ2. After the information is entered in the google form the information will show up in a google form called results located at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dduhfPnC8y9euY5pH7DKONmWR_wIV_UdOF0cSBPD9Q/edit?usp=sharing.  At this point each project can be reviewed and changed based on the preference of the ixo team. When the project characteristics are finialized the reviewer will place a '1' in the column titled verified. 

Once a '1' is found in that column all the information for that project will be grabbed by this program and the schema and form will be generated. Then all of the information will be uploaded to a mongo database and the project creator will be sent an email with instructions on how to finish creating their project.
